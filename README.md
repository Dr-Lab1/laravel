# laravel INSTALL #

1. Install Laravel
   
   There are millions of ways to do it. But we are going to use _Laragon_ which has an internal **composer**. This will prevent us from making too many codes in our CMD.
   - To get laragon, go to https://laragon.org/download/ .
   
   - Install the app... Nothing complicated, just do **NEXT**.
   
   - Open the app.
   
   - Go to _See hidden applications_ then right-click on the laragon application.
   
   - Open _Build a website quickly_.
   
   Then click on **laravel** to install laravel in your computer.
   
   Therefore, a dialog box will appear and you will put the name of the folder that will contain your laravel project
   
   _These commands will update the latest current version of **LARAVEL**_
   

2. Run Laravel

   Launch laragon, open your browser. Enter in the URLs the name of your folder followed by a period then test
   => _folderName.test_
